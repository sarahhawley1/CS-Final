# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project? Scavenger Space

Scavenger Space

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

I am creating a video game where the player is shares a space ship with a cremate. They work as space junk scavengers, which means they're often away from Earth for years at a time collecting trash to meet their quota. The player will assist their crew mate in the daily duties and aim to return to Earth.  

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

It will be an interactive point and click game. Many objects will be able to be clicked on and interacted with, and there will be multiple text options that yield different results. There will be many different options to choose and different things to interact with, meaning the player can replay and discover something new. I will be creating this game via Scratch because I like how their sprites work, and I feel my familiarity with it can allow me to go above and beyond for this project. This is a story line that I have had in my head for years, so I am excited to bring it to life in a condensed sense. 


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

I will not be combining

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

I will not be collaborating

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will effectively tell the story I set out to do regardless of how detailed and interactive I end up being able to make it. I will have at least 1 mini games, and while text choices can be chosen for different immediate reactions, there will be no effect on the greater outcome and story line

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I will tell the games story in an effective way that draws the player in, I will have sound design that gives it an atmospheric feel, I will have 2 mini games, I will have 2 different story lines that are effected by choices, 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I would like to have multiple rooms that the player can travel between, perhaps even a mini game where they go out in space, I would also like to have a working inventory, and more than 2 mini games and more than 2 possible story lines. There will be the same ending for each story line, but I would like the have different ways the player can reach that end, and I would like this to depend on their choices. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I'm exploring digital art as I will be creating a majority of the artwork. I love art but usually in the traditional paper sense, so there will be a learning curve with that. I've also been researching the way that you can implement sound into Scratch which is something I have never done. I will also need to work on my organization as I often tend to get lost in my Scratch projects by not properly naming the sprites and their costumes. I've also had to get familiar with changing the overall background of the screen for different occasions. I've only ever moved sprites around on the same background so that has been difficult. Also, I want the background to have movement and life to it, so I've have to learn how to rapidly alternate between slightly different backgrounds to give the appearance of twinkling stars and such.
